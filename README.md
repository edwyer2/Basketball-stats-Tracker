# Basketball-stats-Tracker
code for a basic basketball stats tracker. 

OOP Enhancements- This project has applied the OOP principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Encapsulation is applied through the player and teams classes which encapsulate the basketballl stats, keeping them together and hiding details from outside code. Inheritance is shown the star player class as it inherits the attributes from the parent (player) class. Polymorphism is shown on the next line as the code overrides the show_stats method from the player class and makes a new one. These enhancements improve my project by making the code my concise and easier to understand. It prevents me from having to write hundreds of lines of code by allowing subclasses to inherit the trait of parent classes and by using method override to change certain attributes of subclasses
